# Google Tasks Extension for VS Code

## Manage your To-Do list ✅ without going out of your Code Editor 🤖.

> This is **not** similar to extensions like 🌳 [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree), which shows a tree view of the //TODO: comments in the source code

> This is not an official product of Google

This extension is about viewing your list of tasks from the [Google Tasks](https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772) in the tree view of [VS Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Extension usage analytics

We are a company trying to build a business and we want to measure how this extension is used and how much it's used, so we track some usage analytics completely anonymously – e.g. whether you've inspect an entity in via the Debt Ratings tree view.

No personal information is tracked and neither is any code.

We simply track events that look like this:

{
"event": "note.add",
"timestamp": "2019-09-10T16:03:08.938Z",
"userId": "d939629a-b73d-4c65-bf7a-d59aa8b12594",
"sessionId": "fb71462a-f2a8-4343-999d-5cff2ee7079e"
}
We plan to make this configurable in the future so you can opt out.
